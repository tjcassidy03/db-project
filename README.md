# Database Systems Final Project

This is the repo for our group's project, which is a manager for a users' Spotify accounts.

Our group consists of:
* Thomas Cassidy
* Jack Nickerson
* Ian Douglas

When running code in the P5 directory, first create a virtual environment, and pip install the requirements.txt file. 
You need to also create a .env file containing the password for the mysql database.
